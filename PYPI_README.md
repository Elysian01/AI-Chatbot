# AI-Chatbot

### Python library for building custom AI Chatbot with just one line of code.


## Get Started

Install the package
```
pip install aichatbot
```

Load the module
```python
import aichatbot as bot
```

**Create the `intents file` by following format**

```json
{
    "intents": [
        {
            "tag": "tag name",
            "patterns": ["example-1 of user query", "example-2 of user query", "example-3"],
            "responses": ["bot response-1", "bot response-2", "bot response-3"]
        }
    ]
}
```

The `patterns` contains a list of example `expected user query`, which user will enter and `responses` contains the list of `bot response`.

Whenever a user inputs a query, bot will find the closest match with the `patterns`, and then select a random response from the list of `responses` specified under that pattern name.


**Example**

```json
{
    "intents": [
        {
            "tag": "greeting",
            "patterns": ["Hi", "How are you", "Is anyone there?", "Hello", "Good day"],
            "responses": ["Hello, thanks for visiting", "Good to see you again", "Hi there, how can I help?"]
        },{
            "tag": "goodbye",
            "patterns": ["Bye", "See you later", "Goodbye"],
            "responses": ["See you later, thanks for visiting", "Have a nice day", "Bye! Come back again soon."]
        }
    ]
}
```


**Create the model**

```python
filenames = {
    "intents": "./data/basic_intents.json",
    "dir": "dumps"
}

bot_model = bot.CreateBot(filenames, technique="bow")
```

`intents` : Path to your intents file.
`dir`: Specify the directory where you want to save the bot model.
`technique`: Choose among [ bow | lstm | bert ]

That's it ðŸ˜Š, **Start your conversation**
```python
bot.start_bot(bot_model)
```
